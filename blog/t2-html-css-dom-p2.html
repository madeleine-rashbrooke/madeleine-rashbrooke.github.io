    <h3>What is grid based design? </h3>
    <p>Grid based design breaks the page down into a grid of rows and columns, not totally dissimilar to the way a photo/image is made up of a grid of pixels. Elements can take up blocks of multiple rows/columns - a bit like playing Battleships.</p>
    <h3>Whats all the hype about responsive webpages?</h3>
    <p>Well, chaps, these days we have these new-fangled things called smartphones, and some lucky people also have shiny tablets. Plus laptops and desktop screens come in a myriad of sizes. So if you want your webpage to work for all these different displays, you need to build in instructions (and mechanisms) for it to respond to the screen that it's being displayed on. And Google gets cross with you if you don't have a responsive design. And if Google doesn't rank your site, it might as well not exist.</p>
    <h3>What is semantic structure?</h3>
    <p>Semantic HTML is HTML used in such a way that it adds meaning (semantics) to the elements. For example, main headings are defined as such, rather than just elements that have a bigger font and a brighter colour. This helps both developers and web browsers/spiders to know what's important on your page.</p>
