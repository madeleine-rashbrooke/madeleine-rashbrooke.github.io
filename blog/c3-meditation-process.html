    <p><strong>How did the 'process over product' concept influence the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild?</strong> I'm naturally some what of a 'completer/finisher' personality type, so it was quite challenging for me to make myself stop before I had a product I was happy with. It's hard to determine if you've adequately engaged with a process if you're used to assessing it based on the product you've achieved. So to some extent I relied on a time-based measure - I spent 6 hours on the rebuild, and what I had developed at that point is what I've submitted for this week's assignment.

    <p><strong>What did you think about meditation before reading Chapter 2? What new things have you learnt about meditation? Did any of the meditation techniques stand out to you? Any other musings?</strong> I've always thought that meditation was one of those things I should try, but have never really given it a serious attempt. From the Search Within Yourself book, it seems more like extended mindfulness than I'd thought. I managed to follow my breathing for about 6 minutes before I got uncomfortable in my position, which is probably too much like the one I've been working in for the last few hours. Need to work on that lotus!
