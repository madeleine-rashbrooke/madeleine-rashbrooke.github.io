    <h1>Javascript: the early years</h1>
    <p><strong>How does JavaScript compare to HTML and CSS?</strong> Well, they're quite different... HTML is kind of like using labels to frame text/pictures/links to say what they are and broadly how they should be treated when displayed in a web browser. CSS is the finer control of how elements marked with HTML tags are displayed, and how that display changes with the screen size etc. JavaScript is a type of programming language, it's a way of storing and accessing data so that it can be manipulated and used to control events and interactions on a web page. It's what powers the 'when you click here/mouse-over/filter categories/whatever then this happens' stuff.</p>
    <p><strong>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'.</strong> In order for computers to do what you want them to do, you need to have everything broken down into a series of 'do this, then if this is true, do this other thing' or 'while this is still happening, do this thing' steps. It's not enough to say 'spread peanut butter on bread' - you need to replace the human value judgement of 'until all the bread is basically covered' with a precise set of procedures.</p>
    <p><strong>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and object literals.</strong> To access data from an array, you need to specify the position you want in the list (or matrix/grid if it's an array of arrays) represented by the array, so myArray[i][j] would specify row i, column j in a 2D array. Object literals are lists of pairs of named properties and their values, so they're not unlike an array. However to get to the data in an object literal, you need to ask for the data by the name of the property, so myObject.name would give you the value that's stored as the name of the object. COnfusingly, there are two types of notation - dots as I've used in this explanation, and also one with square brackets that looks like it's trying to be array-style. Why? Who knows...</p>
    <p><strong>Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</strong> A function is a method, a block of code that carries out an action or set of actions. Functions are particularly useful as they can be used multiple times, when thet're 'called' on different objects or values.</p>
