    <h1>Madeleine's blog post on time management</h1>
    <h3>25 May 2016</h3>
    
    <p><strong>which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</strong> Some of the techniques mentioned are already things I do (or try to do) - mindfulness to counter a tendency to freak out about things, just doing 20 minutes on a scary task, thinking

    <p><strong>what did you find interesting?</strong>I've come across this before, but the 'fixed' vs 'growth' mindsets thing is interesting and the evidence for it is fairly robust (as far as I've read). The power of suggestion to limit potential - the variation of this that I often quote is the one about girls and maths - girls who do reading comprehension exercise about how maths ability isn't actually gender specific do better on a subsequent maths test than those whose reading comprehension text was about some random other topic.</p>
    <p>The behaviour change TED talk was good too - I'm not a fan of affirmations but the tacking on of small virtuous things to existing habits is a good one. I can actually see some of these things in my day to day life - I don't</p>

    <p><strong>what worked for you?</strong> I find the 'just do 20 minutes (and be realistic about how many 20 minutes will be needed for some tasks) to be an effective strategy - I didn't know somebody had christened it the Pomodoro Technigue and made a video.</p>

    <p><strong>which will you experiment further with?</strong> I intend to do more of the small habits/short bursts of activity techniques. Another area to investigate is the 'flow/productivity' stuff.</p>
