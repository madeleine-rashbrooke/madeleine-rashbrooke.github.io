    <h1>Reflections on emotional intelligence</h1>
    <h3>4 June 2016</h3>

    <h2>What did I take from chapter 1 of the Search Inside Yourself book?</h2> 
    <p>That the book would have been better with a good editor! I know that's not really the point, but I thought that the author's points would have been clearer and more effective if the explanations and style had been tightened up. I found myself getting a bit impatient at the mix of science and anecdote - the effect is to reduce the impact of the science bits because you feel the need to evaluate each of them individually, rather than being able to trust the author to have done so himself.</p>
    <p>There's also a very shaky premise - that happiness is some kind of an absolute. I'm always cautious about arguments that focus on the 'happiness' of monks - the obvious counter example is that people in cults often report high levels of happiness and contentment etc but we all know how that ends...</p>
    <p>And another quibble with the book (and its ilk generally) is that while it usefully emphasises the important of happiness over hard-wired abilities, it falls into the trap of starting to try to quantify emotional intelligence as if it were IQ, which as we all know is just the ability to perform well in an IQ test. </p>
    <p>All that aside, I'm sure there are lots of engineer-type people out there for whom it's a valuable message - that by thinking about what we're thinking (and feeling) we can learn to think (and feel) more productively.</p>

    <h2>How did I find the two minutes of mindfulness?</h2>
    <p>I quite enjoyed closing my eyes and focuing on my breathing for two minutes - like a micro nap. I also did a couple of minutes of the mindfulness exercise where you consider what every part of your body is feeling, from the pressure of your feet on the floor to the tightness of your neck. I enjoyed the irony of using my phone to run a two-minute timer - I'm sure it would have been so much more authentic if I'd had a monk to ring a gong.</p>
