    <h1>Reflections on web design</h1>
    <p><strong>What is a responsive site and why is responsiveness important?</strong> A responsive site is one that adjusts or 'responds' to the size of the screen that it's displayed on. It's important as people view websites on a wide range of devices from small screened smartphones to giant TVs - and a web developer wants to make sure that visitors have a good experience on all of them. One size doesn't fit all... It's not just about scaling photos and text, you also need to consider the difference between navigating with a mouse (and keyboard) and using one's fat fingers.
    </p>
    <p><strong>What is mobile-first design and why is it important?</strong>Mobile-first design is - as it sounds - about making your design with a mobile phone screen in mind, then adapting it to work on a tablet, desktop or larger. The underlying principle is that you should design for the most challenging set-up and then have an easier task making it look nice on a bigger screen, rather than coming up with something for a desktop which is a nightmare to chop down to work on a phone.
    </p>
    <p><strong>What are frameworks, and what are there pros and cons?</strong>Frameworks are a set of components - html and css (and js) for grids, typographical elements, ways to resize content for different screens - that can be used to make a website, arguably more quickly than doing it all from scratch. To quote, you don't need to reinvent the wheel. The pros are that they come with a host of solutions to common problems - how do I make a button? what's a good style for headings? what's an easy way to make a form for submitting contact details? The cons are that if you only know how to manipulate the elements that are provided to you in the framework ('learning the framework rather than learning the code'), then you're limited to doing the things that the framework designer has set out - you may not be able to do exactly what you want. For the newbie, using a framework can tend to make your site look like the framework template and thousands of other sites.
    </p>
    <p><strong>What is a wireframe and why do we use them?</strong>A wireframe is a schematic diagram of how a webpage is going to be laid out. It's a visual guide for when you come to write the code for where each element is situated, and the exercise of making a wireframe helps the designer/developer to consider and plan the information hierachy - what the visitor show see first, where you want their attention to linger, how they navigate to the next page in your site or take an action e.g. buying something.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Which elements of your wireframes did you find difficult to implement and why?</strong> My wireframes turned out to be a bit ambitious for my skills - I couldn't figure out how to get the righthand side elements (the introduction and blog list) to occur where I wanted them in the mobile design (above and below the project panels, respectively) but also in the third column of a desktop screen. This is a fairly standard design so I'm sure it's possible, but I was running out of time. When I have time, I'll try to engage more with the 'if the screen is x, then do y' machinations in the css.
