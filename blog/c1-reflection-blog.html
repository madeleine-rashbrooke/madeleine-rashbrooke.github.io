    <h1>Madeleine's blog post on the cultural values of the DBC/EDA experience</h1>
    <h3>25 May 2016</h3>
    
    <p>
      <strong>What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</strong> I think it's a very interesting approach to 'vocational' education, tackling the problem of how best to fairly quickly tranform a mixed bag of 'normal' people into the people with both technical and soft skills needed by industry. Almost the opposite of a traditional apprenticeship or trades training.
    </p>
    <p>I did like the 'consumer in a restaurant' versus 'family member contributing to a communal meal' analogy. It highlights the inherent contradiction of applying a free market model to education - turning it into a financial transaction increases the passivity of traditional learning environments, which (it's important to note) aren't intriniscally bad, just not suited to every situation. </p>
    <p>One caveat to the analogy... I think it can be easy to forget that there are a lot of unwritten, non financial contracts at play in a family - there are a lot of expectations of everybody in that kitchen, whether you're scrubbing pototoes or coordinating the whole meal, you still expect to get a decent meal.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>What are your impressions?</strong> One of my most immediate impressions is the depth of belief in the 'mission' held by everybody involved. I can't help but be impressed by the commitment and enthusiam, even though I'm naturally a bit of a cynic.
    </p>

      <strong>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</strong> Well, I've spent a <<em>lot</em> of time studying in a university context and I'm definitely ready to try something different. That said, my training as a scientist is to question everything - that would be the cynic bit - so it will be interesting to see how I engage with some aspects of the EDA learning model.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Have your expectations of EDA changed? </strong>If so, how? I went along to an open day earlier this year, so I think I had a pretty good idea of what I was getting into. The question really is how I will change to make the most of EDA!
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</strong> To some extent I've already answered these two questions - I'm really interested in seeing what I can get out of (and contribute to) this kind of particpant-driven learning set-up, but slightly concerned that my cynicism will get in the way of full engagement with some aspects.
