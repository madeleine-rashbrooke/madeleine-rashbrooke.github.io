    <h1>Daily mindfulness</h1>
    <p><strong>What did you learn from your 'mindfulness conversation'? How did the other person find it?</strong> I haven't got a handy person to have a mindfulness conversation with right now, so I'll have to come back to this exercise later.</p>
    <p><strong>Which of the three suggested techniques will you use to sustain your practice?</strong> The philosophy of 'doing less than you can' and 'taking one breath each day' resonate better with me than the 'have a gym buddy for mindfulness'. For me, turning things into managable tasks rather than mountains to climb is generally the key thing.</p>
    <p><strong>Any other musings?</strong> Not really... Though I do question the focus on meditation-based mindfulness - I really think the most important thing is to be really aware and really living your own life - whiskers on kittens and parcels tied up with string (but not kittens tied up with string) rather than three minutes of deep breathing. Well, maybe it's not an either/or so much as a both/and scenario?</p>
