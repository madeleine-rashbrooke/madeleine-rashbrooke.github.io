    <h1>Self-confidence</h1>
    <p><strong>What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?</strong> According to the Book they're effectively the same thing. Mindfulness means paying attention in a particular way, on purpose, in the present moment and non-judgementally. Self-awareness is a neutral mode that maintains self-refectiveness even in the midst of turbulent emotions. The argument is that beng mindful allows you to steady yourself emotionally, which allows you the space and calm to be self aware. </p>
    <p><strong>Try at least one of the self awareness practices from the chapter (Body Scan, Journaling). What was your experience of it? How did you feel?</strong> I did them both as I read the chapter... I've done the body scan thing before, I quite like it as a form of quasi-focused meditation although I do tend to find that the more I scan the more tension I discover in my body - particularly neck and shoulders. I guess the next step is to use the practice to reduce that tension, rather than just feeling the pain more! I did the journaling exercise too - it's amazing how little you can actually write in two minutes - that time goes fast. I'm not sure I really learnt anything new, just reminded myself of how much I hate reading back over what I've written. Though that's partly the editor in me - I want to correct my grammar and adjust the phrasing to make it flow better - and rework the ideas to make me sound more like a beatnik poet and less like an emo teenager.</p>
    <p><strong>What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not Me" section?</strong>It's obviously a very useful lesson in being aware of the emotion you're feeling and not allowing it to drive you blindly into things, but somehow I felt there was a lack of soul in this chapter. I know it's basically a self-help book written by an American software engineer... so maybe I'm being a bit unfair. I do find the way it's so process-oriented and uses so much cut-and-paste psychology interspersed with 'Buddhism is so cool' anecdotes quite irritating - I find myself struggling to really give it a fair go.</p>
