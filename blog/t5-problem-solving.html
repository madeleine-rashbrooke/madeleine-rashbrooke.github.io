    <h1>Technical blog: problem solving</h1>
    <p><strong>Telling a friend about how I got blocked on a simple problem...</strong> Well, today I took ages to solve the 'eloquent JS' exercise making a chessboard-type arrangement with alternating hashes and spaces. I think I was trying to get it done quickly so I could get on with the rest of the exercises, so I didn't stop to reason out exactly how it needed to be done. Also I thought I could do it the same way we did in Comp102, but then I couldn't quite remember the assignment and eventually concluded we'd done it with an array of arrays, and I didn't think that was what the exercise was supposed to explore. I broke the problem down in a way that seemed logical to me and came up with a solution that worked using a bit of pseudocoding and the console.log to find the places where it wasn't quite right. And got the right answer to print out. But then it didn't seem like a very elegant solution, so I looked at the Hints and that made me think I should try to figure out the solution that the authors indicated. Again, I got a bit tied up with just trying to figure it out as I wrote it, eventually got their via console.log and sketching it out on paper... Throughout the process I felt frustrated and impatient (on top of the headache I already had) and a bit cross with myself for not taking a more methodical approach. It did feel good to find the write anwser(s). I pseudocoded and tried things and console.logged, and muttered to myself (my yellow rubber alter ego), but was trying not to google in this case (though that's usually my go-to) so that I'd be forced to work it out myself rather than stumble upon the answer fully formed. I'm sure this process of reflection in conversation with 'you' will be very helpful...

    <p><strong>Telling a friend about a problem that I solved in an elegant way...</strong> Hmm... I find this a bit difficult to answer. I guess because if I solved the problem in an elegant way, then it didn't seem like a problem. Instead it was a task that was completed and not especially noteworthy. For the purposes of this blog, I guess I'd say those situations are the ones where I feel calm and rational and approach the task without feeling that I should already have finished it. Ideally I use a pseudocode narrative with some internal conversation (I find my id is a better conversationalist than a bath toy), generally some kind of console.log or test output along the way, and sometimes the error messages are helpful (depending on the system and if I'm familiar with it. I'm pretty good at finding answers online but haven't really asked questions via Slack etc as mostly the the questions have already been asked!</p>
    <p><strong>Dear 'non-tech friend', here are some definitions for you...</strong></p> 
    <ul>
    <li>.map() is a way of performing an operation of some kind (mathematical, formatting etc) on an array (a type of data structure that you could think of as a chain of boxes each containing some data or groups of data) and storing the answers/outputs in a new array.</li>
    <li>.filter() is - rather as the name suggests - a way to filter an array for those boxes whose data matches the chosen filtering. The contents of the matching boxes are stored in a new array (chain of boxes).</li>
    <li>.reduce() provides a way to process the contents of the boxes in relationship to each other. This is a bit different to most methods that work on arrays: normally each box gets processed in turn but independently. It can deliver a single value, for example if each element in the boxes are added together or another array.</li>
