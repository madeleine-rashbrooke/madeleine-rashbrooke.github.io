    <h1>Technical blog post after Audacity lesson 1</h1>
    <h3>4 June 2016</h3>
    <h3> Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? How would you describe it to your non-technical friend?</h3>
    <p>I'm going to get in touch with my inner girl and go with a fashion analogy. HTML is the specification of what the person (page) will be wearing from top to toe e.g. a hat, sunglasses, a shirt, some trousers, shoes. The CSS specifies what each garment (element) will look like e.g. shirt and trousers will both be denim and stonewashed, sunglasses will go away if the sun has set. The DOM is like a handbook that sets out the conventions for each element and its styles and makes sure that two people can get dressed identically on opposite sides of the planet.</p>
    <h3>What is meant by boxifying design?</h3>
    <p>Boxifying design is when everything in a design is conceived as a series of box elements - even if the content is not rectangular it can be thought of as contained in a box space.</p>
    <h3>What is the box model?</h3>
    <p>The box model in CSS refers to the box around each HTML element, whether its displayed or not. It consists of (from inside to outside) the content itself, a possible area of padding, a possible border and a possible margin.</p>
